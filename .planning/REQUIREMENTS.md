## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| CRM integration | Email-only for v1, can add later |
| Custom booking system | Calendly handles this well |
| E-commerce/payments | Lead-gen focus, not transactional |
| Live chat | Technical audiences prefer async initially |
| Social media feed embeds | Low impact for B2B (14% influence) |
| Video content | Start with text/images, add later if converting |
| Newsletter popup on entry | Friction before value demonstration |
| Autoplay video/carousels | Anti-pattern for technical audiences |
