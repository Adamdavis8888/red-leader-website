<objective>
Create trust signal components (client logos, testimonials, certifications, success metrics) and integrate them into the homepage to support conversion of skeptical enterprise buyers.

Purpose: Enterprise buyers need social proof before engaging. Trust signals provide evidence that other respected companies trust Red Leader, reducing perceived risk of engagement.

Output: Four trust signal components and homepage integration displaying client logos, testimonials with full attribution, certifications, and success metrics.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create trust signals data file</name>
  <files>app/data/trust.ts</files>
  <action>
Create centralized trust data file with:

1. Client logos (TRUST-01):
   - Array of { name: string, logoUrl: string, industry: string }
   - 8-12 placeholder logos representing recognizable enterprise brands
   - Use placeholder paths like "/images/logos/company-name.svg"
   - Industries: Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Technology, Manufacturing
   - Example names (placeholders): "TechCorp", "FinanceFirst", "HealthNet", "RetailGiant", "ManufacturePro"

2. Testimonials (TRUST-02):
   - Array of { quote: string, name: string, role: string, company: string, image?: string }
   - 4-6 testimonials with full attribution (name, role, company)
   - Emergency/crisis focused quotes where possible
   - Example:
     {
       quote: "When our production database went down at 2 AM on a Friday, Red Leader had us back online in 90 minutes. They saved us from a weekend of downtime that would have cost us millions.",
       name: "Sarah Chen",
       role: "VP of Engineering",
       company: "TechCorp"
     }

   - Compliance: SOC 2 Type II (if applicable), ISO 27001 awareness

4. Success metrics (TRUST-04):
   - Array of { value: string, label: string, description?: string }
   - Include response time metric prominently (EMER-03)
   - Examples:
     { value: "< 2 hrs", label: "Average Response Time", description: "From first call to engineer on your systems" }
     { value: "99.9%", label: "Recovery Success Rate", description: "We fix what others can't" }
     { value: "500+", label: "Emergencies Resolved", description: "Critical systems recovered" }
     { value: "99.95%", label: "Client Uptime", description: "After our intervention" }

   - ClientLogos from @/app/components/ClientLogos
   - Testimonials from @/app/components/Testimonials
   - SuccessMetrics from @/app/components/SuccessMetrics
   - Certifications from @/app/components/Certifications

2. Add SuccessMetrics immediately after Hero section (high visibility for EMER-03):
   ```tsx
   {/* Success Metrics - Response time prominently displayed */}
   <section className="py-8 bg-brand-dark">
     <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
       <SuccessMetrics variant="dark" />
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

3. Add ClientLogos after Value Props section:
   ```tsx
   {/* Client Logos */}
   <section className="py-12 border-y border-gray-200">
     <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
       <ClientLogos showHeading />
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

4. Add Testimonials after Services Preview section:
   ```tsx
   {/* Testimonials */}
   <section className="py-16 sm:py-20">
     <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
       <Testimonials limit={3} />
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

5. Add Certifications near the Booking section:
   ```tsx
   {/* Certifications */}
   <section className="py-12 bg-gray-50">
     <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
       <Certifications />
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

6. Maintain existing section order but interleave trust signals:
   - Hero
   - SuccessMetrics (NEW - response time visible immediately)
   - Value Props
   - ClientLogos (NEW)
   - Services Preview
   - Testimonials (NEW)
   - Certifications (NEW)
   - Booking
