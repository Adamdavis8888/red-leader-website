  <name>Task 1: Create company data file</name>
  <files>app/data/company.ts</files>
  <action>
Create centralized company information file with:

1. Company story (3-4 paragraphs):
   - Origin story: Founded by engineers who experienced critical infrastructure failures firsthand
   - The realization: When systems go down, every minute costs thousands - most consultancies respond in days, not hours
   - The mission: Build a team that responds like first responders - available 24/7, trained for crisis, equipped to handle anything
   - Today: Trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most critical infrastructure emergencies

2. Mission statement (outcome-focused, not fluffy):
   - "When your systems fail, we fix them fast. No excuses, no delays, no finger-pointing. Just solutions."

3. Values array (4-5 values with descriptions):
   - "Speed Over Perfection" - In emergencies, a working solution now beats a perfect solution tomorrow
   - "Radical Transparency" - We tell you what's broken, why, and how we're fixing it. No mysteries.
   - "Deep Technical Mastery" - We invest in expertise so we can solve problems others can't
   - "Client Success First" - Your uptime is our reputation. We don't win unless you win.

4. Milestones array (4-6 entries with year, title, description):
   - 2018: "Founded" - Red Leader launches with a focus on emergency infrastructure rescue
   - 2019: "First Fortune 500 Client" - Trusted to recover a major retailer's e-commerce platform during Black Friday
   - 2020: "Pandemic Response" - Helped 50+ companies scale infrastructure for remote work overnight
   - 2022: "24/7 Coverage" - Expanded to true around-the-clock emergency response team
   - 2024: "100th Enterprise Client" - Milestone reached with 99.9% recovery success rate

5. Stats for the page:
   - { value: "99.9%", label: "Recovery Success Rate" }
   - { value: "< 2 hrs", label: "Average Response Time" }
   - { value: "500+", label: "Emergencies Resolved" }
   - { value: "24/7", label: "Availability" }
