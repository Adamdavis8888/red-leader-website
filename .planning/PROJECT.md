# Red Leader Website

## What This Is

A lead-generation focused marketing website for Red Leader, a tech consulting company specializing in emergency infrastructure rescue, cloud modernization, and high-availability systems. The site targets CTOs and engineering leaders at mid-to-large companies who need rapid infrastructure recovery and modernization services.

## Core Value

Emergency response is the differentiator — when systems are down, Red Leader fixes them fast. The site must make this capability immediately clear and make it effortless to reach us in a crisis.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Home page emphasizing emergency response capability
- [ ] Services section covering all offerings (emergency recovery, cloud migration, infrastructure modernization, CI/CD, networking, disaster prevention, training)
- [ ] 2-3 case studies with before/after success stories
- [ ] About page establishing credibility and team expertise
- [ ] Contact page with form (email submissions)
- [ ] Blog infrastructure with initial posts
- [ ] Calendly integration for consultation booking
- [ ] Click-to-call emergency hotline prominently displayed (always visible)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Fast loading performance
- [ ] Professional design (IBM/Accenture caliber)
- [ ] Trust signals (testimonials, certifications, success metrics)

### Out of Scope

- CRM integration — email-only for v1, can add later
- Custom booking system — using Calendly instead
- E-commerce/payments — this is lead-gen, not transactional
- Client portal — focus on acquisition, not retention features
- Multi-language support — English only for v1

## Context

**Business context:**
- Red Leader is an established tech consulting company with existing branding (logo, colors, fonts)
- Content is mixed — some real content available, some will be placeholder initially
- Primary differentiator is 24/7 emergency response capability

**Technical context:**
- Tech stack: Next.js 14+ with Tailwind CSS
- Form handling: Email submissions (no CRM integration for v1)
- Booking: Calendly/Cal.com embed
- Hosting: TBD (likely Vercel for Next.js)

**Target audience:**
- CTOs and engineering leaders at mid-to-large companies
- Decision-makers facing infrastructure crises or planning modernization
- People who value speed, reliability, and expertise

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js 14+ with Tailwind CSS — chosen for performance and SEO
- **Content**: Mix of real and placeholder — structure must accommodate both
- **Branding**: Must align with existing Red Leader brand guidelines

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Next.js 14+ with Tailwind | Modern performance, great SEO, rapid development | — Pending |
| Calendly for booking | No need to build custom scheduling | — Pending |
| Email-only forms | Simple v1, can add CRM later | — Pending |
| Emergency number always visible | Reinforces core differentiator | — Pending |
