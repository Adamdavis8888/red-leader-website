<objective>
Create case study data file and listing page with filtering capability.

Purpose: Enable visitors to browse case studies and filter by crisis type or industry, demonstrating Red Leader's expertise across different scenarios.

Output: Data file with 3 case studies and listing page with working filter UI.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create case study data file with TypeScript interfaces</name>
  <files>app/data/case-studies.ts</files>
  <action>
Create case study data file following the services.ts pattern:

1. Define TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
export interface CaseStudyMetric {
  value: string
  label: string
}

export interface CaseStudy {
  id: string
  slug: string
  title: string
  client: string           // Anonymized client name (e.g., "Fortune 500 Retailer")
  industry: string         // e.g., "E-commerce", "Financial Services", "Healthcare"
  crisisType: string       // e.g., "Database Failure", "Cloud Outage", "Security Incident"
  tagline: string          // Brief hook
  problem: string          // 2-3 sentences describing the crisis
  solution: string         // 2-3 sentences describing what Red Leader did
  outcome: string          // 2-3 sentences describing results
  metrics: CaseStudyMetric[]  // Quantified results (3-4 metrics)
  timeline: string         // e.g., "4 hours", "3 days"
  services: string[]       // Related service slugs
  testimonial?: {
    quote: string
    author: string
    role: string
  }
}
```

2. Create 3 case studies with realistic, compelling content:

Case Study 1: "E-commerce Database Recovery" (Database Failure, E-commerce)
- Fortune 500 retailer, corrupted PostgreSQL during Black Friday
- 47TB database, $2.1M/hour revenue at risk
- Metrics: "4 hrs" recovery time, "$8.4M" revenue saved, "0" data loss, "99.99%" uptime after

Case Study 2: "Financial Platform Cloud Migration" (Cloud Migration, Financial Services)
- Regional bank moving from on-premise to AWS
- Zero-downtime migration of trading platform
- Metrics: "0 min" downtime, "40%" cost reduction, "6 weeks" project duration, "5x" scale capacity

Case Study 3: "Healthcare System Ransomware Recovery" (Security Incident, Healthcare)
- Hospital network hit by ransomware
- Restored critical systems without paying ransom
- Metrics: "18 hrs" to critical systems, "0" ransom paid, "100%" data recovered, "HIPAA" compliant

3. Add helper functions:
- getCaseStudyBySlug(slug: string): CaseStudy | undefined
- getCrisisTypes(): string[] (unique crisis types)
- getIndustries(): string[] (unique industries)
- getRelatedCaseStudies(caseStudy: CaseStudy): CaseStudy[] (by shared services)

Run: `npx tsc --noEmit` - no TypeScript errors

  <done>
Data file exists with 3 case studies, all required fields populated with realistic quantified results, helper functions working

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create case studies listing page with filtering</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/case-studies/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create listing page following services/page.tsx pattern:

1. Add force-static and metadata:
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-static'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Case Studies - Red Leader',
  description: 'Real-world infrastructure rescue stories. See how we\'ve helped companies recover from database failures, cloud outages, and security incidents.',
}
```

2. Build page structure:
- Hero section (brand-dark background, white text)
  - Title: "Case Studies"
  - Subtitle: "Real stories of infrastructure rescue and transformation"

- Filter bar (sticky, below hero):
  - "All" button (default active)
  - Crisis type filter dropdown/buttons
  - Industry filter dropdown/buttons
  - Use client-side state for filtering (useState)
  - Style: pill buttons, brand-red when active

3. Case study grid:
- 3-column grid on lg, 2 on md, 1 on mobile
- Each card shows:
  - Industry + Crisis type badges (top)
  - Client name (anonymized)
  - Title (linked to detail page)
  - Problem summary (truncated)
  - Key metrics (2-3 inline)
  - "Read Case Study" link with arrow
- Card styling: white bg, shadow-sm, hover:shadow-md, rounded-lg

4. Filter logic:
- "All" shows all case studies
- Selecting crisis type filters to that type
- Selecting industry filters to that industry
- Filters can be combined (both active = AND logic)
- Use URL params for shareable filter state (optional, nice-to-have)

5. CTA section at bottom:
- "Have a Similar Challenge?"
- Contact and consultation buttons (match services page pattern)

Use 'use client' directive since filtering requires useState.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `npm run build` - builds without errors
Run: `npm run dev` - page loads at /case-studies
Verify: Filters work (clicking crisis type/industry shows correct subset)
Verify: Cards link to /case-studies/[slug]
  </verify>
  <done>
Listing page displays all case studies, filtering by crisis type and industry works, cards show key information and link to detail pages
  </done>
</task>

1. TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
2. Build succeeds: `npm run build` completes without errors
3. Page accessible: http://localhost:3000/case-studies loads
4. Data renders: All 3 case studies visible on page
5. Filters functional: Clicking crisis type/industry filters the list
6. Links work: Case study cards link to /case-studies/[slug] (will 404 until Plan 02)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Case study data file exists with 3 complete case studies
- Each case study has quantified metrics (numbers, percentages, time)
- Listing page renders all case studies in responsive grid
- Filter by crisis type works
- Filter by industry works
- Page follows established brand styling (brand-red, brand-dark, brand-gray)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-case-studies/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
