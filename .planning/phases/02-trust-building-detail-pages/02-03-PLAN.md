<objective>
Create team section with bios, credentials, and certifications that establishes expertise and builds trust with enterprise buyers.

Purpose: Enterprise buyers want to know who they're working with. Team bios with real credentials (AWS, Kubernetes, etc.) demonstrate the expertise needed to handle critical infrastructure emergencies.

Output: Team data file, TeamSection component, and integration into About page.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create team data file</name>
  <files>app/data/team.ts</files>
  <action>
Create team member data with:

1. TeamMember interface:
   - id: string
   - name: string
   - role: string (e.g., "Founder & Principal Engineer", "Senior Infrastructure Engineer")
   - bio: string (2-3 sentences, focus on expertise and emergency experience)
   - expertise: string[] (e.g., ["Kubernetes", "AWS", "Database Recovery"])
   - certifications: string[] (e.g., ["AWS Solutions Architect Professional", "CKA", "CKAD"])
   - image: string (placeholder path like "/images/team/name.jpg")
   - linkedIn?: string (optional)
   - onCall: boolean (indicates if part of 24/7 rotation)

2. Create 4-5 team members with realistic profiles:

   Example 1 - Founder:
   - name: "Alex Chen"
   - role: "Founder & Principal Engineer"
   - bio: "Built and recovered infrastructure at scale for 15 years. Founded Red Leader after watching too many companies lose millions to preventable outages. Believes every minute of downtime is a minute too long."

   - onCall: true

   Example 2 - Senior Engineer:
   - name: "Jordan Rivera"
   - role: "Senior Infrastructure Engineer"
   - bio: "Former SRE at a major cloud provider. Specializes in database recovery and has personally restored data that other firms declared unrecoverable."
   - expertise: ["PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "MongoDB", "Data Recovery", "Backup Systems"]
   - certifications: ["PostgreSQL Certified Professional", "AWS Database Specialty"]
   - onCall: true

   Example 3 - Cloud Architect:
   - name: "Sam Patel"
   - role: "Cloud Architecture Lead"

   - onCall: true

   Example 4 - DevOps Lead:
   - name: "Morgan Kim"
   - role: "DevOps & Automation Lead"
   - bio: "Pipeline perfectionist who believes if you're doing it more than twice, it should be automated. Has reduced deployment times from hours to minutes for dozens of clients."
   - expertise: ["CI/CD", "GitOps", "Kubernetes", "ArgoCD", "GitHub Actions"]
   - certifications: ["CKA", "CKAD", "GitLab Certified Professional"]
   - onCall: false

3. Export teamMembers array and TeamMember type
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - no type errors.
File exports teamMembers array with 4+ members.
Each member has certifications array with at least 1 certification.
  </verify>
  <done>
Team data file exists with 4-5 team members, each having bio, expertise areas, and certifications. All properly typed.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create TeamSection component</name>
  <files>app/components/TeamSection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create reusable TeamSection component:

1. Component structure:
   - Server component (no 'use client')
   - Import teamMembers from @/app/data/team
   - Accept optional props: { showAll?: boolean, limit?: number }

2. Layout:
   - Section heading: "Meet Our Emergency Response Team" (outcome-focused)
   - Subheading: "Certified experts on call 24/7 for your infrastructure emergencies"
   - Grid of team cards: 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop

3. Team card design:
   - Image placeholder (circle or rounded square, gray background with initials)
   - Name (bold, brand-dark)
   - Role (brand-gray)
   - Bio (text-sm, brand-gray)
   - Expertise tags (small pills, red-100 bg with brand-red text)
   - Certifications list (smaller text, with certification icon)
   - "On Call" badge for onCall: true members (green indicator)

4. Styling:
   - Match existing component patterns
   - Use brand colors
   - Responsive grid
   - Hover effect on cards (subtle shadow)

5. Emergency messaging:
   - Small callout: "Our on-call engineers respond within 2 hours, 24/7/365"
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - no type errors.
Component file exists and exports TeamSection.
  </verify>
  <done>

  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Integrate TeamSection into About page</name>

       <TeamSection />
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

4. Ensure visual flow works with the timeline above and CTA below

  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - no errors.
Visit http://localhost:3000/about - team section visible with all team members.
