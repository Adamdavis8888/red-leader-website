<objective>
Create dynamic service detail pages for all 7 services with technical specificity, emergency-focused messaging, and outcome-oriented content.

Purpose: Convert skeptical enterprise buyers by providing depth and proof for each service offering. Technical specificity demonstrates expertise; emergency messaging reinforces core differentiator.

Output: Dynamic route at /services/[slug] with generateStaticParams for all 7 services, centralized service data with enhanced technical content.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract and enhance service data</name>
  <files>app/data/services.ts</files>
  <action>
Create centralized service data file extracting from services/page.tsx and enhancing with:

1. Keep existing 7 services with their ids: emergency-recovery, cloud-migration, infrastructure-modernization, high-availability, cicd-devops, networking, disaster-prevention

2. For each service, add these new fields:
   - `slug`: URL-safe identifier (same as id)
   - `headline`: Outcome-focused (e.g., "Restore Operations in Hours, Not Days" NOT "We Have 20 Years Experience")
   - `longDescription`: 2-3 paragraphs with technical specificity
   - `metrics`: Array of { value: string, label: string } (e.g., { value: "< 2 hrs", label: "Average Response Time" })
   - `technicalCapabilities`: Array of specific technical items (e.g., "PostgreSQL PITR recovery", "Kubernetes pod debugging", "AWS RDS failover")
   - `useCases`: Array of scenario strings
   - `ctaText`: Service-specific CTA (e.g., "Get Emergency Help Now" for recovery, "Plan Your Migration" for cloud)

3. Technical specificity examples by service:
   - Emergency Recovery: "Database corruption recovery (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)", "Kubernetes cluster state restoration", "AWS/GCP/Azure service outage mitigation"
   - Cloud Migration: "Zero-downtime database migration using DMS/pgloader", "Terraform state migration", "Multi-region failover setup"
   - Infrastructure Modernization: "Docker containerization of legacy Java/.NET apps", "Kubernetes deployment patterns (Helm, Kustomize)", "Service mesh implementation (Istio, Linkerd)"

4. Export helper function: `getServiceBySlug(slug: string): Service | undefined`

5. Export type: `Service` interface with all fields
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - no type errors.
Grep for technical terms: `grep -E "Kubernetes|PostgreSQL|Terraform|Docker" app/data/services.ts` returns multiple matches.
  </verify>
  <done>
Service data file exists with all 7 services, each having technical specificity, outcome-focused headlines, and metrics. getServiceBySlug function exported.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create dynamic service detail pages</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/services/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create dynamic route page with:

1. Static generation setup:
   - `export const dynamic = 'force-static'`
   - `generateStaticParams()` returning all 7 service slugs
   - `generateMetadata()` for SEO with service-specific title/description

2. Page structure (following existing page patterns):
   - Hero section with outcome-focused headline (from service.headline)
   - Emergency CTA banner (same pattern as services/page.tsx)
   - Response time metrics display prominently (use service.metrics)
   - Long description with technical specificity
   - Technical capabilities list (with checkmark icons, same style as services page)
   - Use cases section
   - Related services section (link to 2-3 other services)
   - CTA section with service-specific text and links to /contact and /#book

3. Emergency-focused messaging:
   - For emergency-recovery service: Add "Crisis right now?" section at top
   - For all services: Include "Need urgent help?" sidebar/callout with phone number
   - Use emergencyPhone pattern: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMERGENCY_PHONE || '+1-555-123-4567'`

4. Styling:
   - Use brand colors (brand-red, brand-dark, brand-gray)
   - Follow existing component patterns from services/page.tsx
   - Responsive design matching existing pages

5. Handle 404:
   - If slug not found, call `notFound()` from 'next/navigation'
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - build succeeds with static pages generated for all 7 services.
Visit http://localhost:3000/services/emergency-recovery - page loads with technical content.
Check page includes "Kubernetes" or similar technical term in content.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 7 service detail pages render at /services/[slug] with technical specificity, outcome-focused headlines, emergency messaging, and response time metrics.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update services overview with links to detail pages</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update existing services overview page:

1. Import services data from @/app/data/services instead of inline array

2. Add "Learn More" link to each service card pointing to /services/[slug]

3. Keep existing layout and styling intact

4. Update service cards to show 1-2 metrics from service data (e.g., "< 2 hr response" badge)

5. Ensure emergency CTA banner remains prominent
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - no errors.
Visit http://localhost:3000/services - all service cards have "Learn More" links.
Click "Learn More" on any service - navigates to detail page.
  </verify>
  <done>
Services overview page imports centralized data, displays metrics badges, and links to individual detail pages for all 7 services.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. All 7 service URLs are accessible: /services/emergency-recovery, /services/cloud-migration, /services/infrastructure-modernization, /services/high-availability, /services/cicd-devops, /services/networking, /services/disaster-prevention
3. Each detail page shows technical specificity (grep for Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Terraform, Docker, etc.)
4. Each detail page displays response time metrics
5. Emergency phone number appears on all service pages
6. Headlines are outcome-focused (no "X years experience" type headlines)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Visitor can navigate from services overview to any of 7 service detail pages
- Each service detail page displays technical specificity appropriate to that service
- Response time metrics (e.g., "Average response: 2 hours") appear prominently on emergency-recovery page
- Emergency-focused messaging (phone number, urgent help callout) appears on all service pages
- All headlines are outcome-focused (describe results, not credentials)
- Static generation works for all pages (`npm run build` succeeds)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-trust-building-detail-pages/02-01-SUMMARY.md`
